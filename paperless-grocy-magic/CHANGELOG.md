# Changelog - Paperless Grocy Magic

All notable changes to Paperless Grocy Magic will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1-beta] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- **📂 Configurable Alias Storage Location** - Choose between local (`/data`) or shared (`/share`) storage!
- New configuration option: `alias_storage_location` (values: `local` or `shared`)
- Automatic migration from `/data` to `/share` when switching to shared mode
- Shared storage allows multiple Home Assistant add-ons to access the same aliases
- Storage location clearly logged on startup

### Changed
- `Config` class now includes `alias_storage_location` property
- `AliasManager` initialization now accepts custom file path
- Startup logs show which storage location is being used

### Technical Details
- **Local mode** (default): Aliases stored in `/data/product_aliases.json`
  - Isolated per add-on
  - Included in add-on specific backups
- **Shared mode**: Aliases stored in `/share/paperless-grocy-magic/product_aliases.json`
  - Accessible by multiple add-ons
  - Shared across Home Assistant instance
  - Can be accessed via File Editor add-on
- Migration happens automatically on first startup when switching from local to shared
- Original file in `/data` is preserved (copied, not moved) for safety

### Configuration Example
```yaml
# Use local storage (default)
alias_storage_location: "local"

# Or use shared storage (accessible by other add-ons)
alias_storage_location: "shared"
```

### Use Cases
- **Local**: Single add-on usage (default, recommended for most users)
- **Shared**: Multiple add-ons need access to same aliases (advanced usage)
- **Shared**: Manual editing via Home Assistant File Editor
- **Shared**: Sharing aliases with custom scripts/automations

## [0.6.0-beta] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- **🔗 Product Alias System** - Map receipt product names to Grocy products for exact matching!
- New `AliasManager` module for managing product name mappings
- Aliases bypass fuzzy matching for guaranteed accuracy
- Case-insensitive alias matching
- Persistent alias storage in `/data/product_aliases.json`
- New API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/aliases` - List all aliases
  - `POST /api/aliases` - Add new alias
  - `DELETE /api/aliases/<name>` - Remove alias
- New UI section: "🔗 Product Aliases" with full management interface
- Add aliases with receipt name → Grocy product ID/name mapping
- Optional notes field for each alias
- Visual table showing all configured aliases
- One-click delete for aliases
- Match results now show if matched via alias or fuzzy matching

### Changed
- `ProductMatcher` now checks aliases FIRST before fuzzy matching
- `ProductMatch` includes `via_alias` flag to indicate match source
- Receipt processing results show alias matches with ✅ indicator
- `PriceUpdateService` accepts optional `AliasManager` parameter

### How it works
1. Parse receipt → Extract product name (e.g., "Vorderhaxe")
2. **NEW:** Check if alias exists → If yes, use exact Grocy product (bypass fuzzy matching)
3. If no alias → Fall back to fuzzy matching
4. Update price or create product

### Example Usage
**Problem:** Receipt shows "SW-VORDERHAXE" but Grocy has "Schweinshaxe gegart"
- Fuzzy matching score: 45% (too low, no match)

**Solution:** Create alias
- Receipt Name: `sw-vorderhaxe`
- Grocy Product: `Schweinshaxe gegart` (ID 123)
- Result: ✅ 100% match via alias!

### Technical Details
- Aliases stored as JSON array in `/data/product_aliases.json`
- Receipt names normalized to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
- Alias lookup happens before expensive fuzzy matching operations
- Aliases persist across container restarts
- Full CRUD operations via REST API

## [0.5.0-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Added
- **🎉 Full Paperless-ngx Integration** - Automatic receipt processing!
- New `PaperlessClient` for Paperless API communication
- Query documents by tag (configurable, default: "ebon")
- Filter by custom boolean field (configurable, default: "Bon verarbeitet")
- Auto-download PDFs from Paperless
- Auto-extract text from PDFs
- Auto-process receipts and sync to Grocy
- Auto-mark as processed in Paperless after success
- New API endpoint: `POST /api/process-paperless`
- New UI button: "🚀 Process Paperless Receipts"
- Configurable settings: `paperless_tag`, `paperless_processed_field`

### Workflow
1. User clicks "Process Paperless Receipts" in UI
2. System queries Paperless for documents with tag "ebon"
3. Filters to only unprocessed (custom field empty or false)
4. Downloads each PDF
5. Extracts text using PyPDF2
6. Parses receipt (REWE parser)
7. Creates/updates products in Grocy
8. Adds to stock with prices
9. Marks document as processed in Paperless
10. Shows detailed results in UI

### Configuration
```yaml
paperless_url: "http://paperless:8000"
paperless_api_key: "your-api-key"
paperless_tag: "ebon"
paperless_processed_field: "Bon verarbeitet"
```

### Technical Details
- Paperless API: `/api/documents/`, `/api/tags/`, `/api/custom_fields/`
- Downloads PDF via `/api/documents/{id}/download/`
- Updates custom field via PATCH `/api/documents/{id}/`
- Supports multi-page PDFs
- Detailed result reporting per document
- Error handling for failed documents

## [0.4.1-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- **Switched from pdfplumber to PyPDF2** - Faster Docker builds!
- PyPDF2 is pure Python (no compilation needed)
- Fixes hanging/slow updates on ARM architectures
- Build time: ~30 seconds instead of 5-15 minutes
- Same functionality, lighter dependencies

### Technical Details
- pdfplumber requires Pillow (image processing library)
- Pillow compilation is very slow on ARM (armv7, aarch64)
- PyPDF2 is pure Python, no C extensions
- Both extract text from PDFs with text layer
- PyPDF2 API: `PdfReader` instead of `pdfplumber.open()`

## [0.4.0-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Added
- **PDF Upload Feature** - Upload receipt PDFs directly in the UI! 🎉
- File input for selecting PDF files
- "Extract Text from PDF" button
- New API endpoint: `POST /api/extract-pdf`
- PDF text extraction using pdfplumber
- Multi-page PDF support
- Extracted text automatically fills textarea
- Visual feedback during extraction

### How to use
1. Open the web UI
2. Click "Choose File" and select a receipt PDF
3. Click "📄 Extract Text from PDF"
4. Text appears in textarea (editable!)
5. Click "🚀 Process Receipt" to parse and sync to Grocy

### Technical Details
- Uses pdfplumber library for PDF text extraction
- Supports multi-page PDFs
- Works with PDFs that have text layer (digital receipts)
- For scanned images without OCR: use Paperless-ngx first
- File upload via FormData (multipart/form-data)
- Returns extracted text + page count + character count

## [0.3.7-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Critical: Empty dict false negative** - Fixed `if result:` treating `{}` as failure
- Product updates now succeed when Grocy returns 204 No Content
- Changed condition from `if result:` to `if result is not None:`
- Fixes "Grocy API returned empty response" errors on successful updates

### Technical Details
- Grocy PUT /objects/products returns 204 No Content on success
- `_request()` converts 204 to `{}` (empty dict)
- Python's `if {}:` evaluates to False (empty dict is falsy)
- Now correctly checking `if result is not None:` instead
- This allows both `{}` (success) and `{"data": ...}` (success with body)

## [0.3.6-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Added
- **Stock management** - Products are now automatically added to inventory!
- New `add_to_stock()` method in GrocyClient
- Purchases from receipts are recorded with prices in Grocy
- Default: 1 unit added to stock per receipt item
- Best-before date: 30 days from purchase (configurable)

### Changed
- After creating a product, it's automatically added to stock
- After updating a product, it's added to stock with new price
- Price is now properly stored via stock API (not product table)
- Log messages: "Created & added to stock" / "Updated & added to stock"

### How it works
1. Parse receipt → Match/create products
2. **NEW:** Add matched products to stock with price
3. **NEW:** Add created products to stock with price
4. Grocy now tracks: product + quantity + price + purchase date

Example:
- Receipt: "Vorderhaxe 7.98€"
- ✨ Creates product "Vorderhaxe"
- 📦 Adds 1x to stock with price 7.98€
- Best-before: 30 days from today

## [0.3.5-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Critical: Removed invalid 'price' field** - Grocy products table has no price column
- Products now create/update successfully without database errors
- Price information stored in description field instead (e.g., "Preis: 7.98€ (REWE)")
- Fixes HTTP 400 error: "table products has no column named price"

### Technical Details
- Grocy stores prices separately (via purchases/shopping_locations), not in products table
- Product creation now works without price field
- Product updates store price info in description for reference
- Format: "Automatisch erstellt - Preis: 1.29€" for new products
- Format: "Preis: 23.00€ (REWE)" appended to description for updates

## [0.3.4-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Enhanced debug logging** - Massively improved API request/response logging
- Logs full URL, request data (JSON), status code, headers, and response text
- Separate handling for JSONDecodeError vs RequestException
- Shows first 500-1000 chars of response for debugging
- Debug logs show exact HTTP communication with Grocy

### Technical Details
- `_request()` now logs request details before sending
- Logs response status/headers/body before processing
- Catches JSONDecodeError separately to show invalid JSON responses
- Shows response text even on exceptions (if available)
- Helps diagnose "empty response" issues by showing what Grocy actually returns

## [0.3.3-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Enhanced error reporting** - Shows actual Grocy API error messages
- Functions now return detailed error messages instead of boolean failures
- `update_product_price()` returns `(success, error_message)` tuple
- `create_product()` returns `(product, error_message)` tuple
- Error messages include full exception details and API responses
- Easier debugging when product updates or creation fails

### Technical Details
- Added exception handling with traceback logging in grocy_client.py
- Debug logging for locations and quantity_units fetch during product creation
- Error messages now propagate from Grocy API → Service → UI/Logs
- User-visible errors show actual failure reasons (permissions, missing fields, etc.)

## [0.3.2-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Grocy connection test** - Fixed "Expecting value" error with /system/info
- Added fallback to /objects/products for connection testing
- Works with Grocy instances that don't have /system/info endpoint
- More robust connection detection

### Technical Details
- Some Grocy versions/configurations don't return valid JSON from /system/info
- Now tries /system/info first, falls back to /objects/products
- Both methods validate Grocy API is accessible
- Logs which method was successful

## [0.3.1-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- Enhanced debugging for Grocy initialization failures
- Detailed logging shows exact step where initialization fails
- Shows Grocy URL and API key prefix in error logs
- Full exception traceback for easier troubleshooting

## [0.3.0-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Added
- **Automatic Product Creation** - Unknown products are now automatically created in Grocy!
- New products get proper price and name from receipt
- UI shows ✨ icon for newly created products
- Created count in statistics (✨ Created: X)
- Separate tracking for updated vs created products

### Changed
- Unmatched products are now attempted to be created
- Success if items were updated OR created (not just updated)
- Better logging: "Created: Product (1.29€)"

### How it works
1. Parse receipt → Extract products
2. Match to existing Grocy products (fuzzy matching)
3. Update prices for matched products ✅
4. **Create new products for unmatched items** ✨ NEW!
5. Report results with created/updated/failed stats

Example:
- Receipt has "Vorderhaxe" (not in Grocy)
- ✨ Creates new Grocy product "Vorderhaxe" with price 7.98€
- Next time: Will match and update price instead

## [0.2.6-beta] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
